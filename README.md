## 1. Conditional Statements in Python: Even or Odd Checker
## 🎯 Aim:
To write a Python program to check whether the given number is even or odd using if...else statements.

## 🧠 Algorithm:
Get an input from the user.
Convert the input to an integer and store it in a variable a.
Use the modulo operator % to check if a % 2 == 0.
If true, print "EVEN".
Else, print "ODD".
End the program.

## 🧾 Program:
```
num=int(input())
if(num%2==0):
      print("Even")
 else:
      print("Odd")
```
## Output:

## Result:
Thus, the program has been successfully executed.

## 2. Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python
## 🎯 Aim:
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving True and False.

## 🧠 Algorithm:
Set variable a to the result of the expression 0 == True.
Set variable b to the result of the expression False == False.
Set variable c to the result of the expression True + True.
Set variable d to the result of the expression False + 9.
Print the value of a with the label "a is".
Print the value of b with the label "b is".
Print the value of c with the label "c:".
Print the value of d with the label "d:".

## 💻 Program:
```
a = (0 == True)
b = (False== False)
c = True + True
d = False + 9

print('a is',a)
print('b is',b)
print('c:',c)
print('d:',d)
```
## Output:
<img width="655" height="293" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3f8e6a0-e10b-4570-bf4e-ce09549fd148" />

## Result:
Thus, the program as been excuted successfully.

## 3. Datatypes-Character Literal in Python
## 🎯 Aim:
To write a Python program that prints the characters 'T' and 'a' using character literals.

## 🧠 Algorithm:
Print the character 'T'.
Print the character 'a'.
## 🧾 Program:
```
v='T'
b='a'
print(v)
print(b)
```
## Output:
<img width="557" height="291" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6ba0f68-2bc3-4716-b3fe-90b8a7b63232" />

## Result:
Thus, the program has been excuted successfully.

## 4. Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python
## 🎯 Aim:
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

## 🧠 Algorithm
Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable a (real part).
Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable b (imaginary part).
Create a complex number x using the complex(a, b) function.
Print the complex number x.
Print the real part of x using x.real.
Print the imaginary part of x using x.imag.
## 💻 Program:
```
x=int(input(''))
y=int(input(''))

x=complex(x,y)

print(x)
print(x.real)
print(x.imag)
```
## Output:
<img width="713" height="373" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5577c5f-1c02-453b-b211-35e8232f10cc" />

## Result:
Thus, the program has been excuted successfully.

## 5. Datatypes-Read and Print a String in Python
## 🎯 Aim:
To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.

## 🧠 Algorithm:
Assign a variable named men_stepped_on_the_moon.
Use input() to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.
Print the value stored in the variable.
## 🧾 Program:
```
men_stepped_on_the_moon=input()
print(men_stepped_on_the_moon)
```
## Output:
<img width="969" height="243" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2ddb8ee-4534-44a5-9219-436bbff2889f" />

## Result:
Thus, the program has been excuted successfully.
